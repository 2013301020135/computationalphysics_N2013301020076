ÉÏ¹Ù¿¡âù2013301020076
# Abstrack  
This is the 6th exercise of computional physics. The project is about the design of cannon trajectory while taking the air resistence into consideration. In addition, the firing system is also designed.  
# Background
- Newton's second law can be applied as

- For the trajectory project, the following conditions should be  applied:  
: No air drag

: Air drag is only related to the velocity
: Air drag is related to its density-isothermal
: Air drag is related to its density-adiabatic
- For the firing system:
