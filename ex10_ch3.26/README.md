# 1.Abstract    
In this report, the Lorentz model is applied to grasp a basic understanding of fluid mechanics, especially Rayleigh-Benard problem. Besides, phase-space plot, Poincare section are investigated.  

# 2.Background    
Lorentz was studying the basic equations of fluid mechanics, which are known as the Navier-Stokes equations and which can be regarded as Newton’s law written in a form appropriate to a fluid. The specific situation he considered was the Rayleigh-Benard problem, which concerns a fluide in a container whose top and bottom surfaces are held at different temperatures. Indeed, he grossly simplified the problem as he reached to the so-called Lorentz equations, or equivalently, the Lorentz model.
