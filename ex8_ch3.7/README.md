上官俊怡 2013301020076
# 1.Abstract    
In this report, a simple pendulum is generalized to include the effects of friction, driving force and nonlinearities. And these effects is found possible to generate chaotic behavior.

# 2.Background    
Examples of oscillatory phenomena can be found in many areas of physics. Perhaps the simplest mechanical system that exhibit such motion is a pendulum, consisiting of a mass that is connect by a string so that it can swing freely in response to gravity.  
In an ideal case, the friction is ignored and the angle the string makes with the vertical is assumed to be small. Such a pendulum undergoes what is known as simple harmonic oscilation. However, elementary-level treatments usually do not consider the behavior of a real pendulum, that is, a pendulum that has some friction, that is driven by an external force, that is allowed to swing to large angles. The motion of such pendulum exhubits many features not found in the simple harmonic case.  

# 3.Methodology and Solution
## 3.1 Physical Model and Analytical Solution
### 3.1.1. Simple Harmonic Motion of Ideal Case
The equation of motion can be deduced from Newton's second law:

with general solution

### 3.1.2. Linear, Forced Pendulum  
- Some damping is introduced. In many cases this damping force is propotional to the velocity, and that is the assumption we will make here. The frictional force we will employ has the form![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?q%5Cfrac%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bd%7D%5Ctheta%20%7D%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bd%7D%20t%7D), since the velocity of the pendulum is![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?l%5Cfrac%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bd%7D%5Ctheta%20%7D%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bd%7D%20t%7D)  
- A driving force is considered. Assume that the driving force is sinusodial with time, with amplitude![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F_D) and angular frequency![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5COmega_D)。  
- These lead to the equation of motion is:  
![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bd%7D%5E2%20%5Ctheta%7D%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bd%7D%20t%5E2%7D%3D-%5Cfrac%7Bg%7D%7Bl%7D%5Ctheta-q%5Cfrac%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bd%7D%5Ctheta%20%7D%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bd%7D%20t%7D&plus;F_Dsin%28%5COmega%20_Dt%29)  
The steady solution is:  
![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ctheta%3D%5Ctheta_0sin%28%5COmega_Dt%20&plus;%5Cphi%29)  
where the amplitude is given by:  
![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ctheta_0%3D%5Cfrac%7BF_D%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B%28%5COmega%5E2_D-%5COmega%5E2%29%5E2&plus;%28q%5COmega_D%29%5E2%7D%7D)  

### 3.1.3. Nonlinear Pendulum
We will now not make the assumption that the amplitude is small. This will allow is to treat situations in which the mass swings to large angles or even all way around the pivot point of the pendulum. Therefore, the equation of a motion that is generated by a nonlinear pendulum without friction and without driving force is:  
![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bd%7D%5E2%20%5Ctheta%7D%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bd%7D%20t%5E2%7D%3D-%5Cfrac%7Bg%7D%7Bl%7Dsin%5Ctheta)  

## 3.2 Numerical Method
Generaize the equation of motion as:

### 3.2.1. Euler-Cromer Method
For each step![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?i), caiculate![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Comega%2C%5Ctheta) at time step![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?i+1)as follows:

## 5.1 damped Pendulum
图1  
Fig.1:This shows a damped pendulum without driving force whose result is given by Euler-Cromer method. The initial conditions for each lines are the same-![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cleft.%5Cbegin%7Bmatrix%7D%20%5Comega%3D%5Cfrac%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bd%7D%20%5Ctheta%7D%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bd%7D%20t%7D%20%5Cend%7Bmatrix%7D%5Cright%7C_%7Bt%3D0%7D%3D0)and![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cleft.%5Cbegin%7Bmatrix%7D%20%5Ctheta%20%5Cend%7Bmatrix%7D%5Cright%7C_%7Bt%3D0%7D%3D0.2),the length of string is 1 meter. The difference in the damping coefficient q is illustrated in the figure.  
It can be seen from this graph that as the damping coefficient increases, the oscillation is less obvious. When q=1,3, the pendulum is under damped. When q=10,30, it is over damped. while ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?q%3D2%5Csqrt%7Bg/l%7D%3D%5COmega), it is critically damped and there is no oscillation.  

## 5.2 Damped Driven Pendulum
图2  
Fig.2: This shows four damped driven pendulums whose results are given by Euler-Cromer method. Each has initial condition![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ctheta_0%3D0.2%2Cq%3D1%2Cl%3D1)while other paremeters are indicated by the label.  
It is obvious that the motion of pendulum is approaching a steady state. The driving force will pump energy into(or out of) the system and the imposed frequency will compete with the natural frequency of the pendulum. The frequency of oscillation is related to the frequency of driving force. The the steady oscillation frequency of the blue line is half as others, just as the driving force frequency. Besides, as![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F_D)increases, the amplitude will also increase, which is due to the fact that driving force is pumping energy into the system.  
动图动图动图做死  
This animated figure shows the variegation of motion with drivng force frequency with parameters setted as![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\theta_0=0.2,q=1,F_D=0.2,l=1). In the steady state, the pendulum amplitude varies. Resonance is the case when the amplitude is the greatest. From the animation, it can be deduced that![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5COmega_D%3D3.0)may generate the resonance with amplitude 0.064.
