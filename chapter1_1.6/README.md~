# 2nd Homework for Chapter 1
## 1. Abstract

For the 2nd homework of chapter 1 of computational  physics, I choose *problem 1.6* as my project.

## 2. Background

The growth of population is related to the birth term as well as the death term, that is to say

the first term corresponds to the birth of new members, while the second term corresponds to deaths.

The software Mathematica gives the solution of the equation as<img src="http://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&chl=N(t)%3D%5Cfrac%7Bace%5E%7Bat%7D%7D%7B-1%2Bbce%5E%7Bat%7D%7D" style="border:none;" />

where the constant <img src="http://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&chl=c" style="border:none;" /> is determined by the initial value<img src="http://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&chl=N(0)%3DN_%7B0%7D" style="border:none;" /> , that is <img src="http://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&chl=c%3D%5Cfrac%7BN_%7B0%7D%7D%7BbN_%7B0%7D-a%7D" style="border:none;" />

The problem requires to be solved in the following way:

- begin by b=0 using Euler method;
- solve it with nonezero values b;
- change initial value of N and a,b to find interesting things. 

For simplicity, I set the initial population N=1unit, and the following calculation of population is based on the unit. Meanwhile, I set the unit of time as year.
The plot can be made as a 3D one.
