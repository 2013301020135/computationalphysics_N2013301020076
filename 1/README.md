#homework for chapter 1
##abstract
For the homework of the 1st chapter of computational  physics, I choose *problem 1.4* as my project.

##background
- There are two particles involved in the decay, ie, nuclei A and B. And B nuclei is the decay product of nuclei A.
- The number of each nuclei is governed by the following differential equations:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\ \frac{dN_B}{dt}&=& \frac{N_A}{\tau_A} -\frac{N_B}{\tau_B}\\
\frac{dN_A}{dt}&=& -\frac{N_A}{\tau_A}
\end{eqnarray*}

 In the above equationsN<\sub>A<\sub>andN<\sub>B<\sub>represent the number of nuclei A and B respectively. tau<\sub>A<\sub>and tau<\sub>B<\sub> are the decay time constants for each type of nucleus.

##the main body
### 1. methodology and purpose
- Mathematically, Euler method is a possible one to solve differential equation.
- Technically in Python, the notion of array and  for-loop can be used for calculation.
- Matplotlib is utilized to depict the data.

### 2.procedure
- Begin by assigning values to each parameters;
- Caculate until the final time;
- Draw a figure indicating the number of each nuclei.

### 3.coding


### 4.running and analysis
