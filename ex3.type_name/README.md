# The Main Body

## Method

### Level1  
- Use 'print' to print it line by line directly.
 
### Level2  

For simplicity, I just print the capital letters. If there are lower-case letters in the input string, my outcome would be the same as what to get from the corresponding capitals.
- Make use of dictionary to assign "value" to each letter.
- Define a function to transform a string into one made of only capitals.
- Record the input letters as a capital string.
- Look for the corresponding value of the letters in the dictionary.
- Print the "value" line by line.

###Level3:
